      <h4>Allow Me to Re-introduce Myself:</h4>

      <p>Hello! My name is Ziv Zamechek and I am Front End Web Developer and graduate of the Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development Program. I'm very excited about the possibility to potentially start my career with Combustion Group! In turn, I created this project utilizing HTML and CSS (two component of your stack), to show you my passion, diligence and commitment to coding and working hard; ways I can make a strong impact on your development team.</p>
      <p>

      <h4>My Passion for Coding:</h4>

      <p>Since graduating from Flatiron School I've been staying very active in my coding, both on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zivolution921/universifit_rails">Github</a>, my <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@ziv921/">blog</a> and my most recent personal project <a href="https://universifit.herokuapp.com/">Universifit</a> (a personal fitness app), which I've been building using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. I can truly say I love coding and am re-inspired everyday by all the new things I am learning, while exponentially growing as a developer! Recently I have learning some Reactjs myself as well.</p> 

      <h4>Why Combustion Group:</h4>

      <p>I would love to work for Combustion Group because of the EUREKA! I feel when I code. Just like your company mission and principles, I think big and work hard (leaving no stoned unturned), to bring the vision of whatever I am creating to life and for the greatest benefit of it's users. I would be honored to be able to contribute my unique skills set, passion for coding and commitment to becoming the strongest developer possible, to help Combustion Group and its clients continue to grow and thrive!</p>

      <p>Thank you for viewing this project. I look forward to your feedback and to speaking again soon.</p>
